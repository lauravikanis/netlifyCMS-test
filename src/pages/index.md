description: From Print Media Designer to Web Developer. Why? Because the future is digital and getting faster all the time. Without the leap into the digital realm, we will stand still - progress instead of stagnation. For me, things no longer "just" have to look good, but also have to function flawlessly. Still far from finished with the journey into the future, I now know how to use technology to make my digital dreams come true.

        I love accumulating new knowledge and learning new things. Currently,
          I am teaching myself how to code. My current goal is to learn how to
          develop beautiful websites and code them by myself. My curriculum
          includes the following languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript..

        Apart from working a lot on my computer, I love nature. In my spare
         time, I like to collect houseplants and propagate the ones I already
         own. My favourite plant is my fiddle leave-fig, but I love all my
         green babies..

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
